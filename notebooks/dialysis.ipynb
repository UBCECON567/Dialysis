The code is available in\n[on github](https://github.com/ECON567/Dialysis). The same\ndocument generates both static webpages and associated jupyter\nnotebooks.\n\n$$\n\\def\\indep{\\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp}\n\\def\\Er{\\mathrm{E}}\n\\def\\R{\\mathbb{R}}\n\\def\\En{{\\mathbb{E}_n}}\n\\def\\Pr{\\mathrm{P}}\n\\newcommand{\\norm}[1]{\\left\\Vert {#1} \\right\\Vert}\n\\newcommand{\\abs}[1]{\\left\\vert {#1} \\right\\vert}\n\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\argmax}{arg\\,max}\n\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\argmin}{arg\\,min}\n\\def\\inprob{\\,{\\buildrel p \\over \\rightarrow}\\,} \n\\def\\indist{\\,{\\buildrel d \\over \\rightarrow}\\,} \n$$\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis assignment will reproduce some of the results of @grieco2017. \n\n## Getting started \n\n[https://vse.syzygy.ca](https://vse.syzygy.ca) provides a convenient\nbrowser based interface to Julia. Open it and log in. This assignment\nis in a git repository at\n[https://github.com/UBCECON567/Dialysis](https://github.com/UBCECON567/Dialysis). Start\nby cloning the git repository to your syzygy directory. Open a\nterminal in syzygy (File -> New -> Terminal). This will open a Linux\nshell in your browser. To clone the git repository, enter \n\n`\ngit clone https://github.com/UBCECON567/Dialysis\n`\n\nThis will create a directory called `Dialysis` containing all the\nfiles related to this assignment. \n\nClicking on the folder icon near the top left of the screen opens a\nfile browser panel. Use it to open the `Dialysis/notebooks`\nfolder. You can complete this assignment by modifying the\n`dialysis.ipynb` notebook. I recommend creating a copy of this\nnotebook, and then working on the copy. You can create a copy by right\nclicking in the file browser panel. Now open your copy of the\nnotebook.\n\nNotebooks consist of a series of \"cells\" of either text written in\nmarkdown or Julia code. If you double click on any of the text cells,\nyou can see the markdown that created it. To go back to the formatted\ntext, execute the cell by either clicking the play icon on the top of\nthe page or typing ctrl and enter together. \n\n\n## Julia resources\n\nThis assignment will try to explain aspects of Julia as\nneeded. However, it at some point you feel lost, you may want to\nconsult some of the following resources. Reading the first few\nsections of either QuantEcon or Think Julia is recommended.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [QuantEcon with Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)\n\n- [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#_colophon) \n  A detailed introduction to Julia and programming more\n  generally. Long, but recommended, especially if you're new to\n  programming. \n\n- From the julia prompt, you can access documentation with\n  `?functionname`. Some packages have better documentation than\n  others. \n\n- [https://julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/) is the website for\n  Julia\n  \n- Documentation for core Julia can be found at\n  [https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/). All\n  Julia packages also have a github page. Many of these will include\n  package specific documentation.\n\n- [Notes on Julia from ECON\n  628](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON628_2018) much of this is part\n  of QuantEcon, but not all\n\n- [The Julia Express](https://github.com/bkamins/The-Julia-Express)\n  short book with examples of Julia usage\n  \n\n<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->\n\n# Part I: Loading and exploring the data\n\n## Loading packages\n\nLike many programming environments (R, Python, etc), Julia relies on\npackages for lots of its functionality.The following code will\ndownload and install all the packages required for this\nassignment (but the packages will still need to be loaded with `using\n...`). Execute this cell. It will take some time. While the cell \nis running, there will be a `[*]` to the left of it. This will change\nto `[1]` (or some other number) after the cell is finished\nrunning. The number indicates the order in which the cell was\nexecuted. You can execute cells out of order. This can be useful\nduring development, but you should always make sure that your notebook\nworks correctly when cells are executed in order before considering it\ncomplete (that is, make sure the \"Run -> Restart Kernel and Run all\nCells\" menu option produces the output you want). Don't worry about\nunderstanding the details of the code in this section."

I originally downloaded the data for this\nproblem set from\n[https://dialysisdata.org/content/dialysis-facility-report-data](https://dialysisdata.org/content/dialysis-facility-report-data).\nAs in @grieco2017 the data comes from Dialysis Facility Reports (DFRs)\ncreated under contract to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (CMS). However, there are some differences. Most notably,\nthis data covers 2006-2014, instead of 2004-2008 as in @grieco2017 .\n\nThe R script\n[https://bitbucket.org/paulschrimpf/econ565/src/master/assignments/production-R/dialysis/downloadDialysisData.R](downloadDialysisData.R)\ndownloads, combines, and cleans the data. Unfortunately, dialysisdata.org\nhas reorganized their website, and the data no longer seems to be\navailable. Similar (likely identical) data is available\nfrom\n[https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=dialysis](https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=dialysis). It\nmight be useful to look at the documentation included with any of the\n\"Dialysis Facility Report Data for FY20XX\" zip files. Anyway, the\nresult of the R script is the `dialysisFacilityReports.rda` file\ncontained in this git repository. This R data file contains most of\nthe variables used by @grieco2017."

Staffing variables with no suffix are staff as of\nJanuary 31, year as reported in year + 1.  Staffing variables with\n\".l1\" are staff as of January 31, year - 1 as reported in year +\n1. If there were no reporting errors, the .l1 variables would equal\nthe lag of the ones without .l1. However, you might find that this is\nnot the case.\n\nAs explained in downloadDialysisData.R, data collected in year Y has\ninformation on most variables in years Y-1, Y-2, Y-3, and\nY-4. However, for some variables and survey years, only information in\nyears Y-2, Y-3, Y-4 is included. For such variables, at year Y-1, I\nuse the value reported in survey year Y if it is available. If not, I\nuse the value reported in survey year Y+1. The variables ending with\n\".p3\" instead use the convention to use use Y-2 values if available\nand the Y-1 ones if not. Again, if there were no reporting errors the\nvariables with and without .p3 would be the same. \n\nThere are three variables for the number of patients treated. The data\ndocumentation describes `patient_months` as\n\n\"Prevalent Hemodialysis Patient Months (7a): The monthly prevalent\nhemodialysis patient count at a facility includes all non-transient\npatients (home and in-center) who receive hemodialysis as of the last\nday of that calendar month. Incident patients (those who received ESRD\ntreatment for the first time ever) are included in this count.  Row 7a\nreports the number of prevalent hemodialysis patient months  reported\nat  the  facility  each  year.  The  number  of  patient  months  over\na  time period  is  the  sum  of  patients  reported  for  the  months\ncovered  by  the  time  period.  An individual patient may contribute\nup to 12 patient months per year.\"\n\n`patient_years_rom` is the number of patient years at risk of\nmortality. `patient_years_hd` is number of patient years at risk of\nhospitalization. Since hospitalization data is constructed from\nMedicare records, a patient is considered at risk of hospitalization\nonly when one can be reasonably certain that a hospitalization would\nbe billed to Medicare. Dialysis patients who pay for for\nhospitalization with other methods could have unobserved\nhospitalizations. The data guide explains,\n\n\"Ideally, this table includes only patients whose Medicare billing\nrecords include all hospitalizations for the period.  To achieve this\ngoal, we require that patients reach a certain level of Medicare-paid\ndialysis bills to be included in hospitalization statistics, or that\npatients have Medicare-paid inpatient claims during the period.  For\nthe purpose of analysis, each patient’s follow-up time is broken into\nperiods defined by time since dialysis initiation. For each patient,\nmonths within a given period are included if that month in the period\nis considered ‘eligible’; a month is deemed eligible if it is within\ntwo months of a month having at least \\$900 of Medicare-paid dialysis\nclaims or at least one Medicare-paid inpatient claim.  In setting this\ncriterion, our aim is to achieve completeness of information on\nhospitalizations for all patients included in the years at risk.\"\n\n## Create some variables\n\nNot all variables used @grieco2017 are included here. Some\nvariables will need to be transformed to be comparable to what is in\nthe paper. For example, net investment in stations in year $t$ is the\ndifference between the number of stations in year $t+1$ and year in\n$t$."

Medicare\ncollects the data we are using in part to create the \"Dialysis\nFacility Compare\" website, which is meant to allow consumers to\ncompare quality of dialysis facilities. Browsing around the [Dialysis\nFacility\nCompare](https://www.medicare.gov/dialysisfacilitycompare/#profile&pid=522543&pdist=2.0&loc=53129&lat=42.9388315&lng=-87.997164&sort=12%7CASC&dist=0&previouspage=results&profTab=2)\nor by looking at the first few pages of a [sample Dialysis Facility\nReport](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Sample-Dialysis-Facility-Report-for-Current-Year/82bq-h92z),\nyou will see that there are a number of other variables that Medicare\nconsiders indicators of quality. Pick one of these (it may or may not\nbe included in the extract of data I provided), and argue for or\nagainst using it instead of or in addition to the septic infection rate and\nstandardized mortality ratio. \n\nWe can construct residuals from an OLS regression as follows:"

        "Be sure to add the other columns. If you'd like, you could use\n[RegressionTables.jl](https://github.com/jmboehm/RegressionTables.jl)\nto produce tables that look a lot like the ones in the paper. \n\n## Estimation of $\\alpha$\n\nAs discussed in section 5 of @grieco2017, the coefficient on quality,\n$\\alpha$, is estimated from \n$$\ny_{jt} = \\alpha q_{jt} + \\Phi(\\underbrace{h_{jt}, k_{jt}, l_{jt}, x_{jt}}_{w_{jt}}) +\n\\epsilon_{jt}\n$$\nwith a second noisy measure of quality, $z_{jt}$, used to instrument\nfor $\\alpha$. To estimate $\\alpha$, first the exogenous variables,\n$w$, can be partialed out to give:\n$$\ny_{jt} - \\Er[y_{jt} | w_{jt} ] = \\alpha (q_{jt} - \\Er[q_{jt}|w_{jt}]) +\n\\epsilon_{jt}\n$$\nwhere we used the assumption that $\\Er[\\epsilon_{jt} | w_{jt} ] = 0$\nand the fact that $\\Er[\\Phi(w) | w] = \\Phi(w)$. Under the assumption\nthat $\\Er[\\epsilon| z, w] = 0$, we can estimate $\\alpha$ based on the\nmoment condition:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n0 = & \\Er[\\epsilon f(z,w) ] \\\\\n0 = & \\Er\\left[ \\left(y_{jt} - \\Er[y_{jt} | w_{jt} ] - \\alpha\n(q_{jt} - \\Er[q_{jt}|w_{jt}])\\right) f(z_{jt},w_{jt}) \\right]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nIf $Var(\\epsilon|z,w)$ is constant, the efficient choice of $f(z,w)$\nis \n$$\n\\Er[\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial \\alpha} |z, w ] = \\Er[q| z, w] - \\Er[q|w]\n$$\nTo estimate $\\alpha$, we simply replace these conditional expectations with\nregression estimates, and replace the unconditional expectation with a\nsample average. Let $\\hat{\\Er}[y|w]$ denote a nonparmetric estimate of\nthe regression of $y$ on $w$. Then, \n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\sum_{j,t} (y_{jt} -\n\\hat{E}[y|w_{jt}])(\\hat{E}[q|z_{jt},w_{jt}] - \\hat{E}[q|w_{jt}])} \n{\\sum_{j,t} (q_{jt} - \\hat{E}[q|w_{jt}])(\\hat{E}[q|z_{jt},w_{jt}] - \\hat{E}[q|w_{jt}])} \n$$\nThe function `partiallinearIV` in Dialysis.jl will estimate this\nmodel. Also included are two methods for estimating\n$\\hat{E}[y|w]$. `polyreg` estimates a polynomial series regression,\nthat is it regresses $y$ on a polynomial of degree $d$ in $w$. To\nallow the regression to approximate any function, the degree must\nincrease with the sample size, but to control variance the degree must\nnot increase too quickly. We will not worry too much about the choice\nof degree here. \n\nAn alternative method (and what @grieco2017 used) is\nlocal linear regression. To estimate $\\hat{E}[y|x_{jt}]$, local linear\nregression estimates a linear regression of $y$ on $x$, but weights\nobservations by how close $x_{it}$ is to $x_{jt}$. That is, \n$$\n\\hat{E}[y|x_{jt}] = x_{jt} \\hat{\\beta}(x_jt) \n$$\nwhere \n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}(x_jt) = \\argmin_\\beta \\sum_{i,t} (y_{it} -\nx_{it}\\beta)^2 k((x_{it} - x_{jt})/h_n)\n$$\nHere $k()$ is some function with its maximum at 0 (and has some other\nproperties), like $k(x) \\propto e^{-x^2}$. The bandwidth, $h_n$,\ndetermines how much weight to place on observations close to vs far\nfrom $x_{jt}$. Similar to the degree in polynomial regression, the\nbandwidth must decrease toward 0 with sample size allow local linear\nregression to approximate any function, but to control variance the\nbandwidth must not decrease too quickly. We will not worry too much\nabout the choice of bandwidth. Anyway, the function `locallinear` in\nDialysis.jl estimates a local linear regression. \n\n## Problem 5: $\\alpha$\n\nEstimate $\\alpha$ using the following code. You may want to modify\nsome aspects of it and/or report estimates of $\\alpha$ for different\nchoices of instrument, nonparametric estimation method, degree or\nbandwidth. Compare your estimate(s) of $\\alpha$ with the ones in\nTables 5 and 6 of @grieco2017."

The\nfollowing theorem states this idea somewhat more precisely.\n\n### Consistency\n\n**Consistency for extremum estimators**: assume\n\n1. $\\hat{Q}_n(\\theta)$ converges uniformly in probability to\n   $Q_0(\\theta)$\n\n2. $Q_0(\\theta)$ is uniquely maximized at $\\theta_0$.\n\n3. $\\Theta$ is compact and $Q_0(\\theta)$ is continuous.\n\nThen $\\hat{\\theta} \\inprob \\theta_0$\n</div>\n\n\n### Asymptotic normality\n\n**Asymptotic normality for extremum estimators**: assume\n\n1. $\\hat{\\theta} \\inprob \\theta_0$\n\n2. $\\theta_0 \\in interior(\\Theta)$\n\n3. $\\hat{Q}_n(\\theta)$ is twice continuously differentiable in open $N$\n   containing $\\theta$, and $\\sup_{\\theta \\in N} \\Vert \\nabla^2\n                             \\hat{Q}_n(\\theta) - H(\\theta) \\Vert\n                             \\inprob 0$ with $H(\\theta_0)$ nonsingular\n4. $\\sqrt{n} \\nabla \\hat{Q}_n(\\theta_0) \\indist N(0,\\Sigma)$\n\nThen $\\sqrt{n} (\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0) \\indist N\\left(0,H^{-1} \\Sigma\n  H^{-1} \\right)$\n\n### GMM \n\nFor a GMM objective function of the form:\n$$ [1/n \\sum_i g_i(\\theta)] W_n [1/n \\sum g_i(\\theta)]$$, \nif we assume:\n\n1. $1/\\sqrt{n} \\sum_i g_i(\\theta_0) \\indist N(0,\\Sigma)$\n\n2. $1/n \\sum_i \\nabla g_i(\\theta) \\inprob E[\\nabla g(\\theta)] = D$, \n   $W_n \\inprob W$\n\n3. $(D'WD)$ is nonsingular.\n\nthen the above theorem for asymptotic normality of extremum\nestimators implies that \n$$\n\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0) \\indist N(0,\\Omega)\n$$\nwhere \n$$\n \\Omega= (D'WD)^{-1} (D' W \\Sigma W D) (D'WD)^{-1}.\n$$\nIf we additionally assume $W_n \\inprob \\Sigma^{-1}$, e.g. observations\nare independent and $W_n =\n\\widehat{Var}(g_i(\\theta))^{-1}$, then the asymptotic variance\nsimplifies to $(D' \\Sigma D)^{-1}$. This choice of $W$ is efficient in\nthat it leads to the smallest asymptotic variance. \n\n### 2-step estimators\n\nThe above applies to estimators that come from minimizing a single\nobjective function. This application involves a multi-step\nestimator. First, we estimated $\\alpha$ and $\\Phi()$, then we\nestimated $\\beta$ by GMM using moments of the form:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\argmin [1/n \\sum_i g_i(\\beta, \\hat{\\alpha},\n \\hat{\\Phi})] W_n [1/n \\sum g_i(\\beta, \\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\Phi}) ] \n$$\nA similar expansion as above will give\n$$\n\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta} - \\beta_0) \\approx -(D'WD)^{-1} D' W \\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\n\\sum g_i(\\beta, \\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\Phi}) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $D=\\Er[\\nabla_\\beta g(\\beta, \\alpha, \\Phi)]$. If we also expand\n$g_i$ in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\Phi$, we will get, \n$$\n\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta} - \\beta_0) \\approx -(D'WD)^{-1} D' W \\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\n\\sum g_i(\\beta_0, \\alpha_0, \\Phi_0) \\right) + \\Er[\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial\n\\alpha}(\\beta,\\alpha,\\Phi)] \\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\alpha}-\\alpha_0) + \\Er[\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial\n\\Phi}(\\beta,\\alpha,\\Phi) \\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\Phi}-\\Phi_0) ]. \n$$\nSo, there will be additional variance in $\\hat{\\beta}$ from the\nestimation of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\Phi}$. Since $\\alpha$ is\nfinite dimensional, it is not too difficult to derive the distribution\nof $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\alpha}-\\alpha_0)$ and estimate $\\Er[\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial\n\\alpha}(\\beta,\\alpha,\\Phi)]$. However, $\\hat{\\Phi}$ is a function and\nis more difficult to deal with. Under some strong assumptions, \n$$\n \\Er[\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial\n\\Phi}(\\beta,\\alpha,\\Phi) \\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\Phi}-\\Phi_0) ] \\indist N,\n$$\nbut the needed assumptions are slightly restrictive and are tedious to\nstate. An alternative approach is to redefine $g_i$ to ensure that\n$E[\\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial \\Phi}] = 0$. This can be done by\nletting \n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n   g_{jt}(\\beta, \\alpha, \\Phi) = & \\left(y_{jt} - \\alpha q_{jt} -\n   x_{jt} \\beta - h(\\Phi(w_{jt-1}) -\n   x_{jt-1}\\beta) \\right) \\left(x_{jt} -\n   \\Er[x|\\Phi(w_{jt-1}) - x_{jt-1}\\beta]\\right) + \\\\\n   & - \\left(y_{jt-1} - \\alpha\n   q_{jt-1} - \\Phi(w_{jt-1})\\right) h'(\\Phi(w_{jt-1}) - x_{jt-1}\\beta) \\left(x_{jt} -\n   \\Er[x|\\Phi(w_{jt-1}) - x_{jt-1}\\beta]\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $x = (k, l)$, and \n$h(\\Phi(w_{jt-1}) - x_{jt-1}) =  \\Er[y_{jt} - \\alpha q_{jt} - x_{jt}\n \\beta |\\Phi(w_{jt-1}) - x_{jt-1}\\beta]$. It is not too difficult to\nverify that \n$$\n\\Er[g_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)] = 0\n$$\nand \n$$\n0 = D_\\Phi \\Er[g_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)]\\;\\;,\\;\\; 0 = D_h \\Er[g_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)] \n$$\nIn other words, these moment conditions are orthogonal in the sense of\n@chernozhukov2018. Estimation error in $\\Phi$ and $h$ only has second\norder effects on the estimate of $\\beta$. Under appropriate\nassumptions, these second order effects will vanish quickly enough\nthat they can be ignored in the asymptotic distribution of\n$\\hat{\\beta}$. \n\nWe can similarly deal with the uncertainty in $\\hat{\\alpha}$ by\nredefining the moment condition to be orthogonal with respect to\n$\\alpha$. Let\n$$\n\\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta,\\alpha,\\Phi) = g_{jt}(\\beta,\n\\alpha, \\Phi) - \\Er[ D_\\alpha g_{jt}(\\beta_0,\n\\alpha, \\Phi)] \\frac{(y_{jt} - \\alpha q_{jt} - \\Phi(w_{jt}))\n(\\Er[q|z_{jt},w_{jt}] - \\Er[q|w_{jt}])}{\\Er[(q -\n\\Er[q|w])(\\Er[q|z,w]-\\Er[q|w])]}.\n$$\nThen $\\Er[\\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)] = 0$ and \n$$\n0 = D_\\Phi \\Er[\\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)]\\;\\;,\\;\\; 0 = D_\\alpha\n\\Er[\\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)].\n$$\nHence, \n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{j,t} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0, \\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\Phi} )\n= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{j,t} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0, \\alpha_0,\n\\Phi_0 ) + o_p(1) \n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nUnder appropriate assumptions a CLT will apply to $\\tilde{g}_{jt}$, so \n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}  \\sum_{j,t} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\hat{\\beta}, \\hat{\\alpha},\n\\hat{\\Phi} ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}  \\sum_{j,t} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0) + o_p(1)\n\\indist N(0,\\Sigma)\n$$\nFurthermore, $\\Sigma$ can estimated by taking the sample (clustered)\ncovariance of\n$\\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta,\\hat{\\alpha},\\hat{\\Phi})$. Denote this by\n$\\hat{\\Sigma}(\\beta)$. We then have\n$$\n    Q_n^{CUE}(\\beta_0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}  \\sum_{j,t} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0, \\hat{\\alpha},\n    \\hat{\\Phi} ) \\right)' \\hat{\\Sigma(\\beta_0)}^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\n    \\sum_{j,t} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0, \\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\Phi} )\n    \\right) \\indist \\chi^2_{dim(\\tilde{g}_{jt})}.\n$$\nThis can be used to test $H_0: \\beta = \\beta_0$, or to form a\nconfidence region by taking all values of $\\beta$ for which the test\nfails to reject. Such an inference procedure is robust to\nidentification problems in that it does not require an assumption\nabout $D = D_\\beta \\Er[g_{jt}(\\beta,\\alpha_0,\\Phi_0)]$ being full rank or $Q_n$ being uniquely minimized\nat $\\beta_0$. If we are willing to assume strong identification in that \n$(D' \\Sigma(\\beta_0)^{-1} D)$ is invertible (and, loosely speaking, the estimated\nversion of this is far from singular relative to its estimation\nerror), then we can take an expansion to get \n$$\n\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta} - \\beta_0) = (D'\\Sigma^{-1} D)^{-1} D'\\Sigma^{-1}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\tilde{g}_{jt}(\\beta_0, \\alpha_0, \\Phi_0) + o_p(1)\n\\indist N(0, (D' \\Sigma^{-1} D)^{-1}).\n$$\n                                              \n\nSee my notes from 628 on [extremum estimation](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/pschrimpf/628/extremumEstimation.html)\nand on\n[bootstrap](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/pschrimpf/628/bootstrap.html)\nfor more details.\n\nThe `objective_gm` function in Dialysis.jl constructs the $Q_n^{CUE}$\nobjective function described above.
